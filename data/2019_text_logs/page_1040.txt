Yoa. They were at a party on Hoxsey St and she got him back
to her apt to go to bed. He was last seen about 0310Hrs.
They got into an argument and he left the apt and was trying
to make it to a B + B on 1020 Cold Spring RA where his
parents are staying. He never made it there because he
wasn't familiar with the area. He last texted his sister
about 0350Hrs for address of B + B. She hasn't heard
anything since. Which she believes his phone is dead.
